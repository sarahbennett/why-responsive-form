    <h1>Why Choose Responsive Web Design?</h1>
    <p>Responsive Web Design (RWD) allows a site’s page to reformat and reorganize itself depending on which device its being viewed on. This ensures that the content can be viewed consistently and effectively across any phone, tablet, or desktop computer. Here are just a few of the ways RWD will make your website better, and your life easier.<p>
    <h2>User-Friendly, First and Foremost</h2>
    <p>Everyone hates pulling up a site a site on their phone that’s just not built for smaller devices. The pinching, the zooming, the missing content – it’s the small frustrations like this that can make the difference in choosing one service provider or product over another. The user experience is critical to a brand's digital performance. Website features that load slowly, lack cohesion, or format poorly across devices can make a company appear unprofessional or outdated. RWD ensures that the message, mission, and brand are transmitted to the user’s delight regardless of device used.</p>
    <h2>Maintain Content in One Location</h2>
    <p>With RWD, there’s no need for an entirely separate mobile website. No separate mobile site means any changes take place across all platforms, and makes tracking analytics easier. Managing and maintaining site changes can be achieved through a single administrative interface, without the hassle of designing independently for mobile each time.</p>
    <h2>Consumer Tested, Google-Approved</h2>
    <p>Google, the great gorilla of the Internet, happens to love Responsive Web Design! So much so, that they actually favor mobile-optimized sites when organizing search-engine results. Responsive websites can be easily indexed, easily shared, and keep your users (who happen to also be Google’s users) happy. It’s easy to see why Google gives a boost to those who go Responsive.</p>
